Selected Dataset: 
* intel image classification

First steps try to get parameter for normalization.
The result was terrible in ever batch there were some completely black ans some completely white images.

## The Project.

I choose the intel-image-classification data set I found on Kaggle.
The goal of the project is to set up an resnet similar to the on we used in the course.

The dataset contains anotated images. 
The goal is to train an convolutional network based on this data.

## First steps

* use the course project 05b-cifar10-resnet as starter.
* add the dataset to the kaggle notebook.


## Lessons learned so far

Not all Images in the dataset have the same dimensions. This must be fixed before training.
