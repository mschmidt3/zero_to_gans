Selected Dataset: 
* intel image classification

First steps try to get parameter for normalization.
The result was terrible in ever batch there were some completely black ans some completely white images.

## The Project.

I choose the intel-image-classification data set I found on Kaggle.
The goal of the project is to set up an resnet similar to the on we used in the course.
